I'm a full-stack software engineer with a passion for education technology and machine learning. I love building products that help people learn and grow.

When I'm not coding, you can find me reading about psychology, productivity, and entrepreneurship. I also enjoy photography, music production, and exploring Austin's vibrant food scene.

## What I'm up to:

- Building educational technology products
- Writing about software engineering and learning
- Exploring machine learning applications
- Contributing to open source projects

Feel free to reach out if you'd like to chat about technology, education, or anything else! [Send me an email](mailto:jlelonmitchell@gmail.com).
